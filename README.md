# AWS-DevOps-Lab-Test

DevOps Lab Test
Organisation Paktolus
-----------------
You can choose to use any scripting language to automate (great if you could do in Ansible/
Terraform). Use the free-tier resources from AWS. Feel free to comment on your code and/or
put detailed information in the instructions. The exercise will be 2.5 hours.

**## Following is the goals of the exercise:**
1. Demonstrate your hands-on skills, you can code for building cloud hosted solution
2. Demonstrate that you can think of other cross-cutting-concerns like security
3. A nice segue to our discussion after you submit the code

**What we are expecting:**
1. A link to github repo (or a zip/tarball) with code that accomplishes:
- Brings up an AWS instance
- Installs ElasticSearch configured in a way that requires credentials and provides encrypted communication
- Demonstrates that it is functioning

2. Instructions with:
- A short description of your solution describing your choices and why did you make them
- Resources, if any, that you consulted to arrive at the final solution
- How long did you spend on the exercise, and if possible, short feedback about the exercise

3. Must use AWS free tier, however, if youâ€™re using any additional services, please mention them in the instructions

4. ElasticSearch access and communication must be secure

**Bonus:** if you extend your code to create a cluster of 3 ElasticSearch nodes.
